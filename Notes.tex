Ideas of what the variables in county_data are:
\begin{\begin{enumerate}
  \item V1 just says "GUL" ??? come back to this
  \item V2 has strings of numbers that are each 9 numbers long, could be voter id
  \item V3 has last names
  \item V4 appears to be suffixes
  \item V5 is likely last names
  \item V6 appears to be middle names/initials
  \item V7 has a yes and no answers (Y/N)
  \item V8 through V10 are likely residence addresses
  \item V11 has 2 levels either a space or an asterisk, unclear what it's for
  \item V12 has zip codes both long and short form
  \item V13 and V14 also apear to have addresses
  \item V16 has 159 cities and is sparsely filled
  \item V17 has state abbreviations
  \item V18 has more zipcodes
  \item V19 has 8 country names (Austria, Belgium, Canada, Costa Rica, Switzerland, United Kingdom)
  \item Its likely that V13 through V19 are the mailing addresses, could be explained by snowbirds and/or dual citizens
  \item V20 is sex, has F M and U. U is probably for people who did not check either box since the only options on the form are Male and Female
  \item V21 has mostly integers 1-5 and a max of 9, could be for race/ethnicity question
  \item V22 has dates, not very recent, likely Date of Birth
  \item V23 also has dates, some very recent, possibly day registration was processed, no other dates asked for on form
  \item V24 7 level factor, partyID
  \item V25 similar structure to V21, not sure what it's for
  \item V26 all 0's, not sure what it's for
  \item V27 continuous variable from 1.1 to 9.1, not sure
  \item V28 just has A or nothing, figure out later
  \item V29 has 2 levels, ACT or INA, likely whether they are an active or inactive voter
  \item V30-V34 more integers, come back to this
  \item V35-V37 more integers, but larger
  \item V38 emails for people who want sample ballots emailed to them
  \item lon and lat erased and redone by dario's code 
\end{enumerate}}
